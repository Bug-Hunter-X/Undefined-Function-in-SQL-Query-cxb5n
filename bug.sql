The following SQL query attempts to use a function that doesn't exist or is not accessible within the current database context. This can happen if there is a typo in the function name, if the function hasn't been created yet, if the user doesn't have permissions to access the function, or if the function is located in a different schema.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = getDepartmentName(1);
```
